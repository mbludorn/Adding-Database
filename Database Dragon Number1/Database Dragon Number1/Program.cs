And in this cave lies a book, but not just any book.  This book holds the answers to every single problem that haunt these people.....a goldmine of eternal knowledge.\n\n\nThere is a problem though.  This book which holds all the knowledge of everything for these people just so happens to be guarded by a fierce, giant, fire-breathing dragon!\n\n");
