They were a small race of people, consisting of farmers, shepards, drinkers, gardeners, dancers, and laughers.  They were not a violent race of people.\n\n\nHowever, there town lay at the base of a tall mountain, and at the very top of the mountain, there was a cave.  And in this cave lies a book, but not just any book.  This book holds the answers to every single problem that haunt these people.....a goldmine of eternal knowledge.\n\n\nThere is a problem though.  This book which holds all the knowledge of everything for these people just so happens to be guarded by a fierce, giant, fire-breathing dragon!\n\n");

As you make your way toward it, you become startled when you feel the ground under your feet begin to shake!\n\n\nStomp....Stomp...Stomp...STOMP!
